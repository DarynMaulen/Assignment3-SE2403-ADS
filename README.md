ðŸ“ŒThis project contains custom implementations of common data structures in Java, created as part of an Algorithms and Data Structures course assignment.

ðŸ”¹IMPLEMENTED DATA STRUCTURES:

MyArrayList â€” Dynamic array implementation.

MyLinkedList â€” Doubly linked list implementation.

MyStack â€” Stack implementation using a list. 

MyQueue â€” Queue implementation using a list.

ðŸ”¹KEY FEATURES:

Standard Operations: All structures support `add`, `remove`, `get`, `set`, and more. 

Type Safety: Generic classes with type parameters for flexibility.

Modularity: Code is split into interfaces and implementations for clarity.

Heap Properties: `MyMinHeap` maintains correct heap structure during operations.

ðŸ”¹TESTING:

- TestBST.java:
  
  Tests `put()`, `get()`, `delete()`, and in-order traversal.
  
- TestMyHashTable.java:
  
  Tests `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`, and collision handling.
  
- UniformDistributionTest.java:
  
  Validates uniform bucket distribution for 10,000 elements.
